    "Dash is an open-source Python framework used for building analytical web applications. It is a powerful library that simplifies the development of data-driven applications. It’s especially useful for Python data scientists who aren’t very familiar with web development. Users can create amazing dashboards in their browser using dash.\n",

In other words this decorator knows how to link the drop down definition to the function and take the output and place it in the dcc.Graph .
