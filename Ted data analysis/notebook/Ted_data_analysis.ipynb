    "# Analysing the Ted talk data\n",
    "\n",
    "Founded in 1984 by Richard Saulman as a non profit organisation that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design together, TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan and Bill Gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading' has managed to achieve an incredible feat of bringing world renowned experts from various walks of life and study and giving them a platform to distill years of their work and research into talks of 18 minutes in length. What's even more incredible is that their invaluable insights is available on the Internet for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the time we have begun watching TED Talks, they have never ceased to amaze us. We have learned an incredible amount, about fields we were completely alien to, in the form of poignant stories, breathtaking visuals and subtle humor. So in this notebook, we are attempting at finding insights about the world of TED, its speakers and its viewers and try to answer a few questions."
