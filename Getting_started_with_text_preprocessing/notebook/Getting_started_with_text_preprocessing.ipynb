    "In any machine learning task, cleaning or preprocessing the data is as important as model building if not more. And when it comes to unstructured data like text, this process is even more important.\n",

    "Objective of this notebook is to understand the various text preprocessing steps with code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common text preprocessing / cleaning steps are:\n",

    "* Removal of Frequent words\n",

    "* Removal of URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the different types of text preprocessing steps which we can do on text data. But we need not do all of these all the times. We need to carefully choose the preprocessing steps based on our use case since that also play an important role.\n",
